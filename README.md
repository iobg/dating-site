# Down to Clown

*Down to Clown* is the premier dating app for clowns and clown lovers. This is the dating app for the clown in you.

## Technologies and Team Methodology

This app was built as a MEAN stack project at Nashville Software School. The developers involved were:

+ [Marshall Friskics-Warren](https://github.com/wmfwarren/)
+ [Banks Humphreys](https://github.com/iobg/)
+ [Thomas Swann](https://github.com/tkswann2/)

The project was set up in such away that Swann could only work on the front end and Angular components of the app, while Marshall and Banks could only work on the server and API side of the app.

The group started by planning out what would be needed on Trello. This included basic things like views, but also what GET/POST/etc. requests would be needed and where. This allowed Swann to work on the client while Marshall and Banks worked on the server without needing the code from either.
